            <p>Welcome to this experiment. Today you are going to play the Mirror Game. The Mirror Game is an improvisation game
                where the objective is for participants to synchronize between each other while creating a variety of movements.
                The movements simulate dancing and the game is meant to be played using creative movements that are done making new
                movements that use different trajectories within the game area.
            </p>
            <p>You will play this game with another participant. There will be a score linked to the use of the space, how much time you synchronize in your team and the average distance
                between your teammate and you.
            </p>
