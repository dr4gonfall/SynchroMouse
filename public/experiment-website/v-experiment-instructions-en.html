        <h1>Experiment Instructions</h1>
        <p>
            Welcome to this experiment. In this experiment we want you to play the Mirror Game with an autonomous agent
            as your teammate to analyze trust and improvisation
            while performing a creative task. The objective of the Mirror Game is to perform creative movements while
            synchronizing/complementing with the movements of your
            teammate (i.e., an autonomous agent). In this experiment you will play the Leader-Follower version of the
            Mirror Game a total of 16 times.
            In this version either you or the agent will be assigned the roles of the Leader or Follower at the
            beginning of each game. The Leader is the player who proposes
            and performs movements while the follower complements and/or follows the movements of the leader while
            coordinating. For this experiment we are trying to analyze how
            competent/incompetent and predictable/unpredictable the agents are with some measurements and algorithms we
            have designed. We will present to you different versions
            of the agents and the velocity of both the player and the agent. To analyze the characteristics of the agent
            and the controls, we will ask you to fill a form after each game.
            We want to know which versions of the agents and controls are consistent with our own assessment of the
            agent. We want your honest opinion related to the agents behaviors
            and the controls you used. The order of the versions will be random so do not panic if you feel there is no
            difference between the versions of the game you played.
