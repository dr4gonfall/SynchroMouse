    <h1>Informed Consent</h1>
    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>The purpose of the experiment is to analyze how humans interact with autonomous agents in a creative task (i.e., Mirror Game) by analyzing aspects of trust
        and improvisation. In the Mirror Game you have to work in coordination with another player to create interesting and aesthetic movements while coordinating between each other. For this experiment
        we are going to ask you about your opinions related to the controls of your character and how the agent behaved. We will also gather data about the position
        and time your character had during the game.
    </p>
    <h2>Duration</h2>
    <p>You will play the game for 30 seconds a number of 24 times based on different conditions of the agent and your controls. Between games you will have 10 seconds
        whil the game begins again.
    </p>
    <h2>Procedure</h2>
    <p>You will play with different autonomous agents that have been programmed to be competent/incompetent, predictable/unpredictable and do the function of 
        Leader (i.e., the player who generates the movements) or Follower (i.e., the player who follows the movements of the other player). First, you will be in a 
        training session made up of 1 game with you as the Leader and another one with you as the Follower. Each task will last 1 min. After this, you will have a time
        to ask for questions and then the experiment will begin. In this experiment we will ask you to play the Mirror Game with the agent letting you know if you are
        the Leader or the Follower. At the end of each task we will ask you to fill a survey in a Google forms with the ID we generated for you about your controls 
        and how the agent behaved in terms of competent/incompetent, predictable/unpredictable the agent was. This will be done 24 times with different conditions.
    </p>
    <h2>Risks or Discomforts</h2>
    <p>There is no none risks currently of discomfort.</p>
    <h2>Expected Benefits</h2>
    <p>You will play a game that is fun.</p>
